# ck.dashboard

**ck.dashboard** is a system monitor implemented as a side panel for Linux desktops running Wayland compositors. It is written in **QtQuick** and based on [Quickshell](https://quickshell.org/).

> **Note:** This project is in a very early stage of development and currently provides only minimal functionality.  
> It is primarily intended for developers rather than end users. Backward-incompatible changes may (and will) be introduced at any time.
